# Implementing various Elo rating systems to historic Premier League data

This code implements each of the following rating systems to historic Premier League data (see https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php):
  - 'Classic Elo' (E.A. Elo, *The proposed uscf rating system, its development, theory, and applications*, Chess life 22(8) (1967), pp. 242-247)
  - 'Glicko' rating (...)
  - 'Bayesian approach to Elo' (M. Ingram, *How to extend Elo: a Bayesian perspective*, Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports 17(3) (2021), pp. 203-219)

In future, Elo ratings will be used as predictors for match outcomes, which will be compared to bookmakers' odds (or rather their inferred outcome probabilities).
